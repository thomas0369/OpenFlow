 * MCP entry — is therefore invisible until the engine is restarted, and every
 * one of those flows currently ends in a note telling the user to go and do it
 * in a terminal. There is no shutdown route on the server (checked: nothing
 * under `packages/server/src/handlers`), so the only thing that can restart it
 * is whoever holds the process handle. That is this.
 *
 * Ownership is opt-in and never assumed: a host that did not spawn the engine
 * reports `managed: false` and the UI falls back to showing the command. The
 * one thing this must never do is start a second engine on a port that already
 * has one — see `supervisorFor`.
