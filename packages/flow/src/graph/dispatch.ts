 *
 * OpenFlow drives `client.v2.session.*`, so a card runs through the v2 session
 * runner — and that runner has never been wired to MCP. Its own spec comment
 * says so, unticked, at `packages/core/src/session/runner/llm.ts`:
 *
 *   - [ ] Resolve policy-filtered built-in, MCP, plugin, and structured-output
 *         tool definitions.
 *
 * MCP tools are converted and registered in exactly one place, the *v1* session
 * path (`packages/opencode/src/session/tools.ts`), which OpenFlow does not use.
 * The v2 tool registry (`packages/core/src/tool/`) holds read, grep, glob, bash,
 * edit, write, question, skill, todowrite, webfetch, websearch and apply-patch,
 * and nothing puts MCP beside them — so `openflow_dispatch` comes back as
 * `Unknown tool` from `core/src/tool/registry.ts` however the config is written.
 *
 * `GET /mcp` still answers `connected`, which is what made this look like a
 * config bug for so long: the MCP *service* connects the process and holds the
 * client perfectly well. It simply never contributes a tool definition to a v2
 * session.
 *
 * So the channel is parked, not deleted. Everything it needs is built and
 * tested; flipping this to `true` is the whole of turning it back on the day
 * that checklist line is ticked. Fixing it here is not an option — it would
 * mean editing `packages/core`, and this fork modifies no upstream package.
