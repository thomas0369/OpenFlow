# OpenFlow

Visual builder for multi-agent workflows. Drag role cards onto a canvas, wire a
pipeline (planner → architect → coder), save it, and run it with real parallel
agents on top of a headless `opencode serve`.

A canvas runs in one of three [modes](#modes): a **pipeline** in dependency order,
a **swarm** of peers arguing over rounds until a synthesizer decides, or an
**orchestration** where one card hands work to cards it can see. An orchestration
can be run as a **gauntlet** — builders looped against fresh-context critics until
the work clears a bar you wrote, bounded by money, wall clock and stall.

OpenFlow is its own project, built on — and shipped as a fork of —
[opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode), whose headless engine drives the
agents underneath. Everything OpenFlow-specific lives in this package. No other
package in the repo is modified, so upstream merges stay clean. It is not published
to npm — it is an app, run it from the repo.

> OpenFlow is an independent fork. It is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or
> endorsed by the OpenCode team.

The plan it was built from, and the original build brief, are kept in
[docs/](docs) for the reasoning; the code is the authority where they disagree.

## Install

**Prerequisites:** [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3+ and [Git](https://git-scm.com).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SeeRay11/OpenFlow.git
cd OpenFlow
bun install
```

`bun install` pulls the whole workspace — the OpenCode engine plus this package.
First install is large; it downloads the engine's native deps and runs a
`postinstall` (`packages/core/script/fix-node-pty.ts`) that marks the prebuilt
`node-pty` `spawn-helper` binaries executable. It builds nothing, and it returns
immediately on Windows.

## Stop anything already running

The engine binds **4096** and the canvas **5174**. A previous run still holding
them is the usual cause of `Error: Unexpected error` / `ServeError` from
`opencode serve` — a failed bind, not a broken install. `netstat -ano | findstr
:4096` (Windows) or `lsof -i :4096` names the owner.

`bun openflow.ts` already reuses a healthy engine and frees a port a dead run
left bound, so a manual kill is only needed when you want a genuinely fresh
engine — notably after editing `opencode.json` or merging agents, which the
engine reads once at boot and caches for the life of the process.

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 4096,5174 -State Listen -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
  Select-Object -ExpandProperty OwningProcess -Unique |
  ForEach-Object { taskkill /pid $_ /T /F }
```

```bash
lsof -t -i :4096 -i :5174 | xargs kill -9
```

Both no-op when nothing is listening. Both kill whatever holds those ports, so
confirm the owner first if you run something else there.

## Run it

OpenFlow is two processes — `opencode serve` and the canvas — and the launcher
at the repo root starts both, waits for the engine's `/api/health`, and opens the
browser:

```bash
bun openflow.ts
```

`openflow.ps1` and `openflow.sh` are shims over that same file: they hold no
launcher logic, they only translate their platform's flags into the environment
variables `openflow.ts` reads (`lib/launch.ts` resolves the plan for all three).

```powershell
.\openflow.ps1 -Project C:\code\my-app
```

```bash
./openflow.sh -p ~/code/my-app
```

On Windows, PowerShell refuses unsigned local scripts by default, so the shim can
fail with *"openflow.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on
this system"*; `bun openflow.ts` is not a script PowerShell has to be talked into
running. `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` and
`Unblock-File .\openflow.ps1` are the fix if you want the shim.

| PowerShell | shell | environment | what it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-Project <dir>` | `-p`, `--project <dir>` | `OPENFLOW_PROJECT` | repo the agents read and write |
| `-ServerPort <n>` | `-s`, `--server-port <n>` | `OPENCODE_SERVER_URL` | engine port, default 4096 |
| `-Built` | `-b`, `--built` | `OPENFLOW_BUILT=1` | build and serve `dist/` instead of running vite |
| `-Manage` | `-m`, `--manage` | `FLOW_MANAGE_SERVER=1` | canvas owns the engine, enabling its restart button |
| `-Help` | `-h`, `--help` | — | print the flag list |
| — | — | `OPENFLOW_DRY_RUN=1` | print the resolved plan and start nothing |

A port left bound by a dead run is freed before starting; a port that is already
serving is reused rather than started twice.

By hand it is the same two commands. The server first:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/opencode --conditions=browser src/index.ts serve --port 4096
```

Then the canvas:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/flow dev
```

Open http://localhost:5174 — the dev server binds the `localhost` name, so
`127.0.0.1:5174` refuses the connection. The header shows `connected` once the UI
can reach the server.

### Built, without vite

`bun run build` emits a static bundle, and a static bundle on its own is a dead
page: the `/flow/api` store and the proxy to `opencode serve` are what make save,
load and run work. `server.ts` serves all three.

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/flow start
```

Same URL, same behaviour, no vite. `start` rebuilds before it serves, so it
cannot open an old bundle — `dist/` is not checked against source, and serving a
stale one is otherwise silent. `serve` skips the build for when you have just
run `build` yourself; that is what the launcher's `-Built` uses.

### Loopback only

`/flow/api` writes pipelines and run logs into the project and merges agents into
its `opencode.json`, and nothing authenticates the caller. On loopback that is
you talking to your own machine; on a real interface it is a remote file-write
hole in whatever repository OpenFlow is pointed at.

So both hosts refuse to serve anything but loopback unless `FLOW_ALLOW_REMOTE=1`
says otherwise — `bun start` exits, and `vite --host` fails to start rather than
coming up with the store quietly exposed. Request bodies are capped at 8 MB on
both.

Environment overrides. Setting one differs per shell — `VAR=1 bun openflow.ts` on
bash/zsh/Git Bash/WSL, `$env:VAR=1; bun openflow.ts` on PowerShell,
`set VAR=1 && bun openflow.ts` on cmd, `env VAR=1 bun openflow.ts` on fish:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENCODE_SERVER_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:4096` | server the proxy forwards to, and the port the launcher starts |
| `OPENFLOW_PROJECT` | last used, else repo root | project the agents work in, and where `.openflow/` is written |
| `FLOW_PORT` | `5174` | port for `bun start` (dev server is fixed at 5174) |
| `FLOW_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | interface for `bun start` |
| `FLOW_ALLOW_REMOTE` | unset | exactly `1` allows a non-loopback bind, for both hosts — `true` and `yes` do not count |
| `FLOW_PROXY_TIMEOUT` | `30000` | ms before a proxied `/api` call gives up, on both hosts |
| `OPENFLOW_STATE_DIR` | `~/.openflow` | where the remembered folder and pipeline are stored |
| `FLOW_MANAGE_SERVER` | unset | `1` lets the canvas host spawn and own `opencode serve` (see [the restart button](#the-restart-button)) |
| `OPENCODE_SERVE_COMMAND` | unset | the command that host runs for the engine, when the default is wrong |
| `OPENFLOW_BUILT` | unset | launcher only: build the bundle and serve it through `server.ts` instead of vite |
| `OPENFLOW_DRY_RUN` | unset | launcher only: print the resolved plan and start nothing |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_CONTENT` | unset | stands in for the CLI's `auth.json` when reading importable keys |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME` | `~/.local/share` | root of the path that `auth.json` is read from — `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/auth.json`, on every platform |

### Where it picks up

A full stop and relaunch reopens the folder you were last working in **and the
pipeline you had open in it**, rather than the OpenFlow repo and a blank canvas.

The pipeline is remembered per project — a name only means anything inside the
folder whose `.openflow/pipelines` holds it — and is recorded when you open or
save one. It rides back on `GET /flow/api/context`, so restoring costs no extra
round trip, and it is only reopened if the store still lists it: a pipeline
deleted or renamed outside OpenFlow leaves a blank canvas rather than an error
on every launch.

Folder precedence at boot (`lib/last-session.ts`):

1. **`OPENFLOW_PROJECT`** — including `openflow.ps1 -Project` / `openflow.sh
   --project`. Naming a folder on this launch means it, and a folder picked last
   week must not override it.
2. **the remembered folder**, if it still exists. One that has been moved or
   deleted is dropped, because booting into a missing path fails every
   `/flow/api` route and reads as a broken app rather than a missing folder.
3. **the OpenFlow repo itself.**

Both are recorded host-side in `~/.openflow/state.json` — outside any project,
since they describe the app rather than the repo, and a user might commit or
delete the repo.

## How it talks to opencode

Both hosts proxy `/api`, `/global`, `/event` and `/mcp` to `opencode serve`, so the
browser is same-origin with the server — no CORS and no password plumbing. The
client is `createOpencodeClient` from `@opencode-ai/sdk/v2/client` (the same
client `packages/app` uses).

The store routes live in `lib/store.ts` and are mounted by both the vite plugin
(`vite/flow-store.ts`) and `server.ts`, so dev and built cannot drift into two
different stores.

`@opencode-ai/sdk-next` is deliberately *not* used: its `OpenCode.create` builds
`createEmbeddedRoutes()` and runs the server in-process through Effect layers,
which is not something a browser app can do.

Endpoints driven, all v2:

| Call | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| is the engine up | `GET /api/health` |
| create a node's session | `POST /api/session` |
| send the node prompt | `POST /api/session/{id}/prompt` |
| detect completion | `GET /api/session/active` |
| read the node's answer | `GET /api/session/{id}/message` |
| live status | `GET /api/event` (SSE) |
| stop | `POST /api/session/{id}/interrupt` |
| answer a permission request | `POST /api/session/{id}/permission/{requestID}/reply` |
| answer a question the agent asked | `POST /api/session/{id}/question/{req}/reply` (or `/reject`) |
| mcp status and connection | `GET /mcp`, `POST /mcp/{name}/connect`, `POST /mcp/{name}/disconnect` |
| pickers | `GET /api/agent`, `GET /api/model` |
| provider list + stored keys | `GET /api/integration` |
| store a key | `POST /api/integration/{id}/connect/key` |
| remove a key | `DELETE /api/credential/{id}` |

## API keys and models

A fresh install can already run something. `opencode serve` serves the `opencode`
(zen) provider's free tier to a browser that has never seen a key
(`core/src/plugin/provider/opencode.ts`), and OpenFlow lets a node use those
models with no credential connected — the ids ending in `-free`, and only the
ones this build can actually route (`isFreeModel` in `src/server/providers.ts`).
The tier is a shared quota, so a `-free` model answering `429`, or `400`, is that
model being busy or broken rather than the install being wrong; the per-node
**test** button is how you find out which ones are answering right now. Zen's
*paid* models sit on the same row and stay locked, because dispatching one would
bill an account nobody connected.

Everything else needs a key, and the **api keys** button in the titlebar is where
it goes: opencode's own two-step connect dialog — search the providers
models.dev knows, pick one, paste its key (`src/ui/providers-panel.tsx`). Keys go
to the integration store the model catalog reads (`POST
/api/integration/{id}/connect/key`), so a saved key takes effect immediately — no
`opencode serve` restart, unlike an agent merge. Only then do that provider's
models appear in the model menu, which is opencode's `dialog-select-model`
menu: 284px, search at the top, one heading per provider, `↑`/`↓`, `Enter`,
`Esc`.

A provider counts as connected when a key is stored here **or** one of its
environment variables is really set on the host — `GET /flow/api/env` answers
which of the names asked about are set, never their values. That is a whole-row
question, and it stays strict: it answers "which providers did the user connect",
which is not the same question as "which models can run". The free zen tier is an
exception granted per model, not per provider, so zen still reads as unconnected
while its free models remain selectable.

The catalog also lies about what exists. Its `opencode` models come from
models.dev, and on 2026-08-13 it listed 90 while zen served 61 — the other 29
answer a run with `401 Model kimi-k2 is not supported` in about 1.4s. Zen's list
is public, so the host reads it (`lib/zen.ts`, `GET /flow/api/zen-models`,
10-minute cache) and drops the models zen does not serve. When that fetch fails
the answer is `null` and the catalog is left alone — an offline user must not
lose every zen model at once. No other provider can be checked this way: their
`/models` needs the credential, which lives in the opencode server's store and
never reaches OpenFlow.

Three things have to line up before a model runs, and the UI distinguishes them
because they fail in completely different ways:

1. **A credential**, or the free-tier exemption. No stored key and no
   environment variable means the provider is locked and contributes no models
   at all — except zen's runnable `-free` ids, which are unlocked per model.
2. **A runner for the provider's API.** `core/src/session/runner/model.ts`
   routes exactly three shapes: `@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, and
   `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` with a base URL. Anything else — `@ai-sdk/groq`,
   `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`, `@ai-sdk/google` — fails at dispatch with
   `UnsupportedApiError` no matter how valid the key is. Those models are
   listed as **no runner** and their providers sink to the bottom; most of
   openrouter's catalog and all of groq's land there.

   Nine of those providers speak OpenAI chat anyway — upstream's own
   `llm/src/providers/openai-compatible-profile.ts` says so, and publishes the
   base URL: baseten, cerebras, deepinfra, deepseek, fireworks, groq,
   openrouter, togetherai, xai. **Repackage** in the provider panel rewrites
   them as `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` with that URL in opencode's *global*
   config (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`), the only config a run reads — a
   session's location is the engine's cwd, never `OPENFLOW_PROJECT`. The file
   is backed up first, the override follows whichever config dialect the file
   already uses, and the engine is restarted, because config is read once at
   boot. Stored credentials still resolve: the provider id does not change.
   What is lost is any provider plugin keyed to the old package — OpenRouter's
   `HTTP-Referer`/`X-Title` headers, and its disabling of the broken
   `gpt-5-chat` aliases.
3. **A key that is actually accepted, for a model the account may use.**
   Nothing verifies a key when it is stored, and the catalog advertises models
   an account has no entitlement for. The **test** button beside a node's model
   runs one throwaway session and reports the provider's own answer — a real
   `403 Authorization failed` or `410 ... end of life` beats guessing.

`opencode providers login` writes to `auth.json`, which this server does **not**
read for its catalog. If the CLI already holds keys, the panel offers to import
them; the keys are read and connected by the OpenFlow host, so they are never
served to the browser.

| Store route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /flow/api/cli-keys` | provider names in the CLI's `auth.json` — names only |
| `POST /flow/api/cli-keys/import` | connect those keys to the running server |
| `GET /flow/api/env?names=A,B` | which of those variables the host has set — names only |
| `GET /flow/api/zen-models` | model ids opencode zen really serves, or `null` if unreadable |
| `GET /flow/api/repackage` | which OpenAI-compatible providers the global config already repackages |
| `POST /flow/api/repackage` | repackage them there (fixed id list only, backed up, restart required) |

`POST /api/session/{id}/wait` answers `503 Session wait is not available yet` on
this server build, so idleness is derived from `/api/session/active` plus a
finished assistant turn.

## Engine

One node = one primary session. Nodes are grouped into topological layers; the
nodes in a layer are dispatched concurrently (`prompt` only admits the input and
schedules the agent loop, so the fan-out is real), then the whole layer is
awaited before the next starts.

1. Validate — DAG, reachable nodes, models resolvable against `GET /api/model`.
2. Layer with Kahn's algorithm.
3. Dispatch each layer through a pool; prompt = pipeline briefing + role
   instructions + run task + serialized upstream output.
4. Live status from the event bus maps `session.next.*` events onto node badges.
5. Capture each node's final assistant text; write `.openflow/runs/<id>.json`.

### The pipeline briefing

A card is an ordinary `opencode` session and knows nothing about the graph it
sits in, so `pipelineBriefing()` in `src/graph/prompt.ts` prepends a map to every
prompt: what OpenFlow is, every card in the pipeline with its execution layer and
its wiring (`role (id) · receives: … · feeds: …`), which one the card is, and who
reads its output next. Cards are named by the same `role (id)` label the
`# Upstream output` headers use, so one card can refer to another by name and be
understood — a planner told to "hand this to the architect" otherwise has never
heard of an architect.

The handoff rules ride along with the map: do your role's part and stop, do not
redo upstream work, state assumptions rather than asking (nothing is
interactive), and write for the next card rather than for a human — unless
nothing runs after you, in which case the output is the run's answer. That is
what keeps a planner from implementing the change a downstream coder owns.

The run log is checkpointed as the run progresses rather than written once at the
end, so closing the tab halfway through leaves a log of the nodes that finished
instead of nothing at all.

Failure policy: a node error stops its downstream branch (`skipped`), siblings
finish, the run ends `error`. Stop interrupts in-flight sessions and dispatches
nothing further.

**Pipe mode** (toolbar): `ancestors` (default) gives a node every upstream node's
output in execution order; `direct` gives only the nodes wired straight into it.

**Parallel** (toolbar): how many nodes may run at once, 4 by default. Every
concurrent node is another live session against the provider, so a wide layer
run flat out is how a graph earns 429s and a bill nobody sized. The layer barrier
is unaffected — a layer still finishes before the next one starts.

**Timeout** (toolbar): how long a single node may run before the engine gives up
on it, 30 minutes by default. A node whose session never goes idle holds its
whole layer, and everything behind it, for the full wait — worth turning down to
5 minutes when a run should be quick.

## Modes

A canvas has a **mode**, and it belongs to the document rather than to a run: it
is saved, exported and undoable, because switching it changes what the same graph
does. Modes do not nest. Everything about running one session is shared — same
briefing machinery, same permission handling, same live status, same run log —
and only the **scheduler** differs: which cards run, in what order, and what
their prompts carry.

`pipeline` is the default, and what every canvas saved before modes existed reads
as. A mode this build has no scheduler for is refused twice over, in preflight and
again inside the engine, because the engine is callable without preflight and
running a swarm's graph through the pipeline scheduler would spend real money
producing an answer nobody designed.

### Swarm

Every non-synthesizer card is a peer of every other, and `edges` are never read —
a swarm is a node list, not a wiring. The canvas draws the mesh itself and refuses
to start a link, since an edge you dragged would be one the run ignores.

Round 1 gives every agent the same run task; round R re-prompts each agent with
every peer's round R−1 answer. The snapshot is taken **on the round boundary**, so
a peer dispatched early cannot be read by a peer dispatched later in the same
round — otherwise the debate would depend on pool scheduling order. Each peer keeps
**one session** across all rounds, so it remembers its own reasoning and the
provider can cache the prefix; that is why round 1 carries the briefing and later
rounds carry only what changed.

One `synthesizer` card reads the final round and writes the verdict. It is added
when you switch to swarm, it can be deleted, and preflight blocks a swarm without
one. A peer that fails is dropped rather than retried — a new session in round 3
would answer with no memory of rounds 1 and 2 while every peer around it has both —
and the synthesizer is told who is missing, so it does not write a confident
verdict over the hole.

**Rounds** (toolbar): 3 by default, 6 at most. A swarm costs `agents × rounds + 1`
sessions, so rounds multiplies the whole bill: four agents at six rounds is 25
sessions.

### Orchestration

The graph is a **tree**. One root — the card nothing points at — and every other
card owed to exactly one parent. A card with children of its own orchestrates its
subtree through the identical loop one level down, so "subagents deploying
subagents" is bounded by the graph you drew, and every session is a card you can
see, price and re-run. A diamond is refused: the second dispatch would re-prompt a
session still working on the first parent's task.

The orchestrator drives the loop by ending its message with a fenced block holding
`{ "dispatch": [ { "card": "coder", "task": "what to do" } ] }`, or
`{ "final": "the answer" }` when it is done. The **last** block in the message
wins, because a model often quotes the protocol before using it. A malformed block
is handed back with the exact reason and re-asked up to three times, each ask
terser than the last; protocol re-asks are not charged to the dispatch budget,
because they buy nothing and the alternative is throwing away the run. A card id
outside the orchestrator's own children is refused, and so is the same card twice
in one batch — one card is one session, and two assignments would race it.

Leaf cards never see the protocol: they are briefed as subagents, and their final
message is handed back to the parent. Cards nobody dispatched end the run
`skipped` rather than `queued`.

**Depth** (toolbar): 2 by default, 4 at most. **Dispatches** (toolbar): 3 per
orchestrator by default, 6 at most — without a cap, "that was not quite right, try
again" is an unbounded loop that reads as progress the whole way down. An
orchestration costs `1 + Σ(children × dispatches)` sessions per level, and
preflight prints the number before you spend it.

### Gauntlet

A toggle on orchestration, not a fourth mode: same tree, same protocol, same
scheduler. What changes is how it stops — **a written bar instead of a count.**
Builders work, critics judge the result against the bar, and the loop runs until
the work clears it or a bound fires.

The pattern is Matt Shumer's "Claude of Duty" run, and its two lessons are built
in: without a concrete bar a critic invents arbitrary standards and burns tokens,
and **coupled work belongs to one builder in sequence** — fanning lighting, tone
and sky out to cards that could not see each other made the result worse.

**Critics are cards with the `reviewer` role**, read off the role text the same way
a swarm finds its synthesizer, so designating one is renaming a card. A critic gets
a **new session for every verdict**: one that has watched the work improve grades
the improvement rather than the work, which is the exact failure a separate critic
exists to prevent. It costs the cached prefix every round — the price of the
method, not a bug to optimise away.

**The card that assigned the work cannot decide the work is done.** A `final` sent
while no critic has judged the current state is refused once, with instructions on
who to send and what to tell them; a second one **fails the run**. Only a
critics-only batch counts as a verdict — a critic dispatched alongside a builder
judged a folder somebody else was writing to. Both endings stop the burn; only one
tells the truth about what the run produced, and the error says which case it was:
`every critic dispatched failed` when critics were sent and none came back, or
`answered twice without sending the work to a critic` when none was ever sent.

Bounds, all live at once, first to fire wins:

- **Spend** — $5 by default, $500 at most. Priced client-side from models.dev, and
  a card's cost is the sum of every session it has held.
- **Wall clock** — 60 minutes by default, 12 hours at most.
- **Stall** — the same batch (same cards, same task text) dispatched 3 rounds
  running. Measured out here rather than asked of the model, because that is what
  no progress looks like from outside.

A model the catalog cannot price **blocks the run** rather than warning: an
unenforceable spend cap on something designed to run for hours is the one failure
nobody notices until the bill arrives. A missing bar only warns — "make the
orchestrator establish one first" is a real way to work. A missing critic blocks.

A turn the provider refuses for rate limiting is re-sent into the same session
three times, waiting 20s, 40s, then 80s. A gauntlet earns 429s more than any other
mode, because its critic opens a brand-new session on every verdict and is the one
card the run cannot route around.

No vision: a critic reads source, runs builds and tests, and hits a dev server. A
card with `bash` can drive a headless browser and capture the artifact itself,
which is how the runtime lines of a bar have actually been judged here.

### Resuming an interrupted run

The engine runs **in the page**, so a reload, a crash or a closed tab ends a run
with nothing alive to write `done`, `error` or `stopped` — while the sessions
themselves are still on the server and still addressable. A live run is guarded by
`beforeunload`, and whatever gets past that is recoverable: a run still marked
`running` on disk for this canvas, with nothing live, is one the page abandoned,
and **Resume** appears beside Run.

Resuming splits that run log in two. Cards that finished keep their answers and
never run again — reopening a finished card's session only bills. Cards that were
still working are prompted back into the sessions they already hold, which is the
difference between resuming and starting over wearing the old run's name: an
orchestrator seven rounds into a gauntlet remembers every verdict it has read. A
carried card is told once, on its first turn only, that the run around it stopped
and that nothing it produced was discarded — a card given no account of the
silence re-answers what it already answered.

**Re-run failed** is the neighbouring, narrower tool: it reuses the outputs of
everything that finished and re-runs only what did not, in fresh sessions.

## Files it writes

Under `OPENFLOW_PROJECT`:

```
.openflow/pipelines/<name>.json          the graph
.openflow/runs/<runId>.json              per-run log: prompts, outputs, timings
.openflow/generated/<name>.opencode.json generated agent defs
```

`.openflow/runs/` is disposable — worth adding to `.gitignore` if you keep
pipelines in version control.

**save** writes the pipeline and the generated agent block. Saving under a name a
*different* pipeline already holds is refused rather than silently overwriting —
every new pipeline is born `untitled`, so that used to be a reliable way to
destroy the last one. The refusal offers both ways out: rename this one, or save
again to replace the other.

**merge agents** folds the generated block into the project's `opencode.json`
(backed up first, see below) and points every node at its own agent — this is the
only way per-node tool allowlists take effect at runtime, because a session can
only select tools through a named agent.

An agent's key is `<pipeline>-<role>-<node id>` (`agentKey` in
`src/server/store.ts`), so two nodes of the same role no longer collapse onto one
agent whose permissions the last-written node decided. **A pipeline saved before
that change needs one "merge agents" re-run** to pick up the new keys; without it
the pre-flight check reports agents that do not exist on the server.

**run merges too.** Every run folds the current agent block into `opencode.json`
before it starts, so a node never runs against a def you edited but forgot to
merge. The write is skipped entirely when the block on disk is already
identical, so a repeated run neither rewrites the file nor leaves a backup, and
says nothing. A run that cannot read the project's MCP servers refuses to write
at all rather than emit agents missing their `<server>_*` rules, and reports the
failure instead of starting.

**Restart the server after merging.** `opencode serve` reads a project's
`opencode.json` once and caches it — there is no reload route, and dispose does
not re-read it. Agents merged into a running server stay invisible until it
restarts, so the order is: merge agents, restart `opencode serve`, reload the
page, run. Both the merge button and the run pre-flight check for this and say
so rather than letting a node run under an agent that does not exist.

### The restart button

The titlebar has a restart control for exactly that. The server has no shutdown
route, so only the process that started it can restart it — which means the
button does one of two things:

- **the canvas started the engine** (`./openflow.sh -m`, `./openflow.ps1 -Manage`,
  or `FLOW_MANAGE_SERVER=1` on either host): one click stops it, starts it again,
  waits for `/api/health`, and re-reads agents, models and MCP status. About five
  seconds.
- **something else started it** — a terminal, a launcher without that flag: the
  button says so and hands over the exact command to run, rather than pretending
  a click can reach a process OpenFlow has no handle on.

`FLOW_MANAGE_SERVER=1` is opt-in and never adopts a running engine: if the port
already answers, the host leaves it alone and reports the command instead. The
command it would run comes from `OPENCODE_SERVE_COMMAND` when set, otherwise the
source checkout, otherwise `opencode serve --port <port>` on PATH.

### Backups of your opencode.json

A merge rewrites the project's `opencode.json`, so it copies the file aside
first:

| file | what it holds |
|---|---|
| `opencode.json.bak` | the config as it was before OpenFlow ever touched it — written once, never overwritten |
| `opencode.json.prev.bak` | the state before the most recent merge |

Two files because one is not enough: `.bak` alone, rewritten on every merge,
would hold an already-merged copy after the second merge and the original would
be gone — quietly, since `opencode.json` is usually gitignored.

**A commented `opencode.json` is read, never written.** opencode parses its
config with `jsonc-parser` and `allowTrailingComma`, so `//` comments and a
trailing comma are perfectly valid there — but OpenFlow writes the file back as
plain JSON, which would strip every comment. So any write into a config that
carries them (merging agents, adding an MCP server, registering a skill) stops
and says so, and leaves the file exactly as it was. Remove the comments, or make
that change in `opencode.json` by hand.

### Agent config shape

The generated block uses the config's *input* vocabulary — `prompt`, `permission`,
`model`, `mode` — which the server translates on load into the `system` and
`permissions` that `GET /api/agent` reports back. Emitting the reported form
instead gets both fields silently ignored. Verified against a running server in
both directions.

Each tool toggle is written out explicitly: enabled becomes `"allow"`, disabled
becomes `"deny"`, both landing as `{ action, resource: "*", effect }`. The older
`agent.tools` field is marked `@deprecated Use 'permission' field instead` in the
config schema and can only say allow or deny, so it is not used.

Actions the graph says nothing about — `external_directory` above all — are left
out of the map and keep their default, usually `ask`. Those are answered at
runtime, see below.

Names matter, because an unrecognised one becomes a rule that matches nothing
and silently does nothing:

| toggle | permission action | note |
|---|---|---|
| `read`, `grep`, `glob`, `bash`, `webfetch`, `websearch`, `todowrite`, `skill` | same name | |
| `edit` | `edit` | also covers the `write` and `patch` tools |
| `question` | — | special-cased by the server, produces no rule |

`write`, `patch` and `apply-patch` in older saved graphs are folded onto `edit`,
and a deny anywhere in that group wins.

### Permission prompts during a run

An agent can still hit an action whose effect is `ask` — reading a `.env`,
touching a path outside the project. Nobody is watching a headless pipeline, so
an unanswered request would stall that node until the idle wait gives up half an
hour later. The engine subscribes to `permission.v2.asked` and answers every
request for a session it owns, under the toolbar's **permissions** policy:

- **auto** (default) — replies `once`, approving that single call. Deliberately
  not `always`, which would write the approval into the project's saved
  permissions and outlive the run.
- **ask me** — the request surfaces as a card with allow once / always / reject,
  and the node reports `awaiting permission: <action>` until you answer.

Every decision is recorded on the node and in the run log with the action,
resources, reply and policy — an approval that leaves no trace is how a run
quietly changes something nobody expected. Stopping a run rejects anything still
pending rather than leaving the node waiting on an answer that will never come.

### Questions during a run (human in the loop)

A card can stop and ask you something. That is opencode's builtin `question`
tool, enabled per node by the **question** toggle in the inspector's tool list;
with it off the node runs headless and guesses instead. When an agent calls it,
the engine picks up `question.v2.asked`, parks the node (`asking: <header>`) and
shows a modal with the agent's own options — one answer per question, several
labels when the question allows it, plus a free-text box for an answer the
options did not offer.

Unlike a permission ask there is no auto policy, because an invented answer is
worse than none: the agent treats it as your intent. An unanswered question is
therefore *rejected* rather than guessed, and rejection is bounded by a five
minute timeout so a run left alone still finishes rather than holding the node
for the full idle wait. Every exchange is recorded on the node in the run log.

### Attachments

The run bar takes files, and so does each card (inspector → **files**). Pasting
an image into the task field attaches it too, which is how most screenshots get
there. Files are read into `data:` URLs in the browser and sent inline with the
prompt, so there is no upload endpoint, nothing written to the host, and nothing
left behind after a run — at the cost of size, so anything over 4 MB is refused
with a reason rather than failing later as an opaque request error.

A card only receives a file whose modality its model actually accepts, read from
`capabilities.input` on `GET /api/model`. A text-only model in the middle of a
chain is not sent the image; it is told, in the prompt, which files were withheld
and not to claim it saw them, and the run continues. A card with no pinned model
is sent everything, since nothing can prove its model incapable.

## MCP servers

The **plug** button in the titlebar manages the project's MCP servers. Both
kinds are covered: **local** (a command this machine runs, with environment
variables and an optional working directory) and **remote** (an http/sse url with
headers). They are written to the project's `opencode.json` under `mcp`, so the
opencode CLI and TUI see exactly the same set — OpenFlow owns no parallel config.

The panel shows two things at once on purpose. The rows are what the *config*
says; the tag on each row is what the *running server* reports from `GET /mcp`.
They disagree constantly, because `opencode serve` reads its config once at boot:
a freshly added server reads **not loaded — restart server** until it does.
Connect/disconnect act on the live server only — a way to retry a failed
connection without a restart, not a way to change the config.

Per-node access lives in the inspector: each card gets a checkbox per configured
server. An MCP tool is named `<server>_<tool>` and permission actions match by
wildcard, so the generated agent config carries one rule per server
(`"context7_*": "allow" | "deny"`). A card that has never chosen says nothing at
all, which is what a pipeline authored before this existed asked for — it
inherits whatever the server offers rather than being retroactively locked down.

Values in `opencode.json` are plain text. For a secret, prefer an environment
variable the host already holds.

| Store route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /flow/api/mcp` | servers configured in the project's opencode.json |
| `PUT /flow/api/mcp/{name}` | add or update one (backs the config up first) |
| `DELETE /flow/api/mcp/{name}` | drop one from the config |

## Sessions

The history icon in the titlebar opens a column on the left listing the sessions
`opencode serve` holds for the current project, newest first, with a search box
over them. Click one to read its turns; `←` goes back to the list.

These are not a history OpenFlow keeps. Every node is one full primary session on
the server, so they are already rows in OpenCode's sqlite database (`opencode.db`,
drizzle) and this reads them back through `GET /api/session`. A session you start
from the `opencode` CLI or TUI in the same project is listed here too, and one a
card started is listed there — one store, two front ends. Nothing in the panel
writes: it lists and it reads.

The column is closed by default and remembered per browser, because a 240px
sidebar is cheap on a wide screen and not on a laptop — collapsed, the canvas
gets the full width back.

Cards are labelled by generated agent (`plan-and-code-coder-…`) rather than by
title, and the search matches agent, model, id and title. A node never titles its
session, so every one of them is auto-named `New session - <iso>`; labelling by
title would give a column of identical rows, and the server's own `?search=`
looks at nothing else — which is why the filter runs over a fetched page instead.

## Canvas

Hand-rolled: HTML node cards over an SVG edge layer inside one CSS-transformed
viewport, driven by pointer events. `solid-flow` was evaluated and rejected —
last published 2022, three versions, built for Solid 1.5.

- drag a role from the palette onto the canvas, or click it to drop one in
- drag a node header to move it, wheel to zoom, drag empty canvas to pan
- drag the right port onto a left port to connect; cycles are refused
- click an edge to delete it; `Delete` removes the selected node, and `Ctrl`/`Cmd`
  `+Z` puts it back
- click a node to edit role, model, agent, prompt and tools, and to read its
  sent prompt and output
- the model field is opencode's model menu — searchable, grouped by provider,
  `↑`/`↓`, `Enter`, `Esc` — and it lists nothing until a provider is connected;
  a search that only matches unconnected providers offers to connect them

## Headless Runs

The canvas owns its runs, and the engine runs in the page — so starting one
without the page is the scripts' job:

```sh
bun packages/flow/scripts/headless-run.ts <pipeline-name> [task words...]
```

What it does, in the canvas's own order: loads the pipeline from the flow
store, merges the per-node agent defs, connects the engine through the dev
server's proxy, and starts the run over the same tested engine path the Run
button uses. Permissions run on `auto`; arriving questions are rejected so a
card continues on its own assumption. The run log is checkpointed to the flow
store, so a headless run shows up in the canvas's Runs menu like any other.

Exit code 0 only when the run log ends `done`. Node outputs print to stdout,
progress to stderr. A crash watcher keeps the process alive through stray
rejections, and every checkpoint also lands in `/tmp/openflow-checkpoint-<id>.json`
so a killed run still leaves what it had. Run it under `setsid nohup ... &`
when the calling shell may go away.
