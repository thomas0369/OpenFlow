# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenFlow are recorded here. OpenFlow lives in `packages/flow`;
the rest of the repo is a vendored OpenCode fork and is not covered by this file.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-26

- Orchestration can run on contracts. A `refine` canvas refuses an orchestrator's
  first dispatch until it carries a `plan` with `verify` criteria; the criteria
  reach every critic, every result turn and the team board (one `[T0]` line).
- Assignments may carry `evidence` (measured facts ahead of the task, budgeted),
  `skills` (folders from `.openflow/skills`, read by the engine and ridden on the
  card's first turn only) and `avoid` (fenced paths; writes are reported after the
  batch, and a fence another card declares written is refused before it runs).
- New template: **dirigent build** — a cheap briefing card writes the contract,
  a boss runs it.
- Everything is off unless the canvas asks; a canvas that has never set `refine`
  dispatches exactly as it always did.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-09-01

- Keep swarm and orchestration cards out of each other's files: a batch is refused
  before it runs when two assignments declare the same path, and a post-batch
  collision report tells the orchestrator when cards wrote over each other.
- Warn about swarm peers with nothing to disagree about, and about peers that can
  write files.
- Pick up a run the browser tab abandoned instead of starting it over.
- Gauntlet: survive rate limits, count what they cost, and refuse to certify
  unjudged work.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-29

- Run a canvas as a swarm: parallel peers debate over rounds, and a synthesizer
  card writes the verdict.
- Run a canvas as an orchestration: an orchestrator dispatches work to child cards,
  recursively, bounded by the tree you draw.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-29

- Brief every card on the pipeline it runs in.
